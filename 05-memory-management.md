# Memory Management

* This is mainly about heap memory allocation and deallocation.
    * Typically, we call `malloc()` or `calloc()`, and `free()`.
    * However, we will learn how these can be implemented.
    * This is a good exercise to deepen our understanding for low-level programming manipulating
      memory (and every systems programming course does this).
* We are not talking about physical memory here. User processes can only use virtual memory, not
  physical memory.
* You can read more about this topic in the following chapters of
  [OSTEP](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/). Keep in mind that OSTEP's discussions are much
  more in depth, which we consider out of scope for this course. Thus, you can use it as a reference
  but the main source should still be this lecture note.

## Prerequisites

This lecture assumes that you know the following already.

* How to use `malloc()` and `free()` in C and understand what they do.
* How to implement a singly- and doubly-linked list in C.
* The stack and the heap, and how a program's variables use those in C and how they are located in
  them.

## `brk()` and `sbrk()`

* `brk()` and `sbrk()` allow us to increase the heap size by moving the *program break*.
* `man sbrk`
    * **"the program break is the first location after the end of the uninitialized data segment."**
    * **"Increasing the program break has the effect of allocating memory to the process; decreasing
      the break deallocates memory."**
    * Another way to allocate more memory in a process is using `mmap()` which we will discuss in a
      later lecture.
* Though we can just use `sbrk()` to allocate more memory to our process, the call takes long since
  it's a system call that crosses the user-kernel boundary, which has overhead. Thus, it's better to
  get a chunk of memory and manage the chunk piece-by-piece as necessary.
    * `malloc()` calls `sbrk()` to increase the heap size and gives out piece-by-piece as requested
      by a `malloc()` call.
* Question arises: how do you manage the chunk?
    * Allocation strategies
    * Deallocation strategies

## Overview

* A memory allocator manages the heap. As a program requests memory allocation, it returns a pointer
  to an unused (or *free*) region inside the heap.
* In order to do that, the memory allocator needs to keep track of which part of the heap is not
  used.
* During execution, a program requests heap allocation and frees allocated regions. Thus, the heap
  can be *fragmented*, i.e., some regions are allocated while other regions are freed.

  ```bash
  Heap
  +-----------+
  | Used      |
  |-----------|
  |           |
  | Freed     |
  |           |
  |-----------|
  |           |
  | Used      |
  |           |
  |-----------|
  |           |
  | Used      |
  |           |
  |-----------|
  |           |
  | Freed     |
  |           |
  +-----------+
  ```

* In order to keep track of unused regions (or *blocks*) of the (fragmented) heap, we can use a
  linked list of free blocks.
    * Note that we only keep track of free blocks. This is because `malloc()` does not need to know
      about allocated blocks, and `free()` receives the block to deallocate as its parameter. (This
      will be more clear after we look at the details later.)
* We will look at this in detail below, but briefly, it works as follows.
    * We start with a large chunk of memory, and we mark the entire chunk as a free block. The head
      pointer of the linked list points to the free block.
    * For the rest of the steps below, assume that we somehow have a linked list of multiple free
      blocks. It will become clear later how we can have multiple free blocks.
    * `malloc()` works generally as follows.
        * We first pick a large enough free block from the linked list. There are many ways to find
          such a block and we will discuss a few algorithms later. For now, let's just assume that
          we have a way to pick a large enough free block from the linked list.
        * We remove the chosen free block from the linked list.
        * We *split* the free block into two blocks---one block with the requested size, and the
          other block with the rest.
        * We return the pointer to the first block to the requester, i.e., the first block's address
          is the return value of `malloc()`. The block is now allocated.
        * We insert the new free block back into the *head* of the linked list, i.e., we make the
          new free block as the first block in the linked list.
    * `free()` works generally as follows.
        * We insert the block that's being freed into the *head* of the linked list. This is the
          same as what `malloc()` does with a new free block. We always insert a new free block into
          the head of the linked list.
    * The reason why we can have multiple free blocks is because a program can call `malloc()` and
      `free()` any time as it runs. When `malloc()` is called, it splits a free block into an
      allocated block and a new free block. When `free()` is called, it inserts an allocated block
      back into the linked list. Thus, as `malloc()` and `free()` are called throughout the program,
      blocks are allocated and inserted back into the linked list, creating multiple free blocks.

## Linked List Management

* Let's look at the linked list management in more detail.
* Basics
    * We have a linked list of free blocks.
    * The head always points to *the most recent* free block.
    * The general algorithm for `malloc()` is what is described above.
        * Pick a free block from the linked list.
        * Remove it from the linked list.
        * Split the free block into two blocks, allocated and free.
        * Insert the new free block back into the *head* of the linked list.
        * Return the allocated block to the caller.
    * The general algorithm for `free()` is just inserting the given block into the head of the
      linked list, as described above.
* Details
    * We use a *header* for each free block to keep track of the size of the free block and a
      pointer to the next free block.
    * We also perform *coalescing*, that combines multiple, consecutive free blocks into a larger
      single free block.
* Below is an example with the heap size of 256 bytes. Let's assume that `size` and `next` are 8
  bytes each.

  ```bash
  Initial state:

* Avoiding *external fragmentation* using *coalescing*: if there are consecutive free blocks, we
  combine them into a larger block. This makes room for larger allocation requests.
    * External fragmentation
        * We might run into a scenario where we have left with many small blocks that can't satisfy
          a large allocation request, *even if the total sum of all free blocks exceeds the size of
          the large allocation*. This is called external fragmentation.
        * There's a similar problem called *internal* fragmentation. We will discuss it in [Virtual
          Memory](06-virtual-memory.md)

## Finding a Free Block

* Allocating memory (e.g., serving a `malloc()` call) requires us to find a big enough memory block
  that can satisfy the request.
* There are three strategies we can consider.
    * First-fit
        * We traverse the linked list of free blocks, and allocates the first block that can fit the
          requested size.
        * We keep the remaining free space free for later requests. I.e., we *split* a free block
          into two blocks, one to allocate and the other to keep as free.
        * An advantage of this is its implementation simplicity. Also, it is fast as it only needs
          to find the first big enough block.
        * A disadvantage is that sometimes it pollutes the beginning of the free list with small
          objects, leading to more search time for bigger allocation requests.
    * Best-fit
        * We traverse the linked list and allocate the smallest free block that is big enough.
        * We keep the remaining free space free for later requests.
        * An advantage of this is that it reduces wasted memory space.
        * A disadvantage is that it must search the entire list (unless ordered by size which has
          additional implementation complexity).
        * Another disadvantage is that it may create many small free blocks, leading to more chances
          of external fragmentation explained earlier.
    * Worst-fit
        * We traverse the linked list and allocate the largest free block.
        * An advantage is that it produces large leftover free blocks.
        * A disadvantage is that it must search the entire list.
